					<h2>Film Review: Amores perros</h2>
					<p>2025/09/04</p>
				</div>
				<div class="wrapper main-text">
					<p><i>Amores perros is a film directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and first released in 2000.</i></p>
					<p>What are the things that love makes us do and what are we without love but savage dogs? The film follows three different stories that are loosely connected. The first story is about Octavio's unrequited love for Susana, and his dog Cofi. The second one is about Daniel who leaves his wife and daughters for Valeria, and her dog Richie who is involved in a car accident. The last story is about El Chivo who tries to reconnect with his daughter Maru, El Chivo has many dogs.</p>
					<p>This is a beatiful film about love and its inmense power. It shows the absurd things we can do to conquer the ones we love. That no matter what happens to those who we love, we stay with them and love them still. And that we are nothing without love.</p>
