					<h2>Movie Review: Mulholland Drive</h2>
					<p>2025/05/03</p>
				</div>
				<div class="wrapper main-text">
					<p><i>Mulholland Drive is a film directed by David Lynch and released in 2001.</i></p>
					<p>Sometimes we have dreams and sometimes these dreams turn into nightmares. Do we even have a choice in what happens or is everything recorded? Where is the band? Are we even doing anything or is there something that pulls us somewhere? Are we taken there or have we chosen to go there? Do we even know who we are and what we want?</p>
					<p>This is a great movie, it may mean something to me and something completely different to you, that's ok. The first half of this movie is a dream, and the second half is the nightmare we are awoken to. It reminds me of the blue rose in Twin Peaks. There are no good and bad dreams I guess.</p>
