					<h2>Book Review: Yesterday</h2>
					<p>2025/08/19</p>
				</div>
				<div class="wrapper main-text">
					<p><i>Yesterday is a book written by Ágota Kristóf first published in 1995 in French. I read it in Italian.</i></p>
					<p>Living alone in exile and with no love, is it life or is it just passing time? In his childhood, Tobias Horvath lived with his mother, a whore, and one day his father, one of her clients comes and tells her that he is going to take Tobias with him, to teach and educate him. Tobias stabs his father and leaves his country. Eversince then he has been waiting for Line to come, just passing time. Once she arrives, he starts to live once again.</p>
					<p>The book has a writing style that I enjoyed very much, it is very simple and direct. I also like the different themes of love, life, lies, and immigration. After he lives his home country, Tobias doesn't consider his life a life per se. Once Line arrives, he loves and thus lives. Working in the factory stops being a chore and becomes a blessing because he will be able to see Line. If Line ever leaves, he will go back to passing time. He is not the only one who lives when he loves, Jean, Vera, Eve, and Paul do too. For those who love doesn't work, they either choose to pass time as Tobias does or to die. Most of the characters in the book who Tobias associates with are immigrants too while natives are seen as just a group of homogeneous people that don't feel any emotions, and if they do have any emotions Tobias doesn't care to understand them. Tobias lives a life of lies, is he not able to feel anything because of this? He is constantly trying to forget.</p>
