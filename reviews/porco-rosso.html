					<h2>Film Review: Porco Rosso</h2>
					<p>2025/09/28</p>

				<div class="wrapper main-text">
					<p><i>Porco Rosso is a film directed by Hayao Miyazaki and released in 1992.</i></p>
					<p>When a pig flies. Set after the first world war in Italy, a pig named Porco is a bounty hunter of the skies, he flies his red plane and hunts down pirates. An American pilot comes to challenge him while Porco tries to forget his past.</p>
					<p>I think this was my third viewing of this film and I still really like it. It is probably my favourite Studio Ghibli film. The animation is excellent. The story, though simple, is very entertaining and is able to touch different subjects in an interesting light. It is a very feminist film, female characters play important roles and break the preconceived notions of the men in the film. It touches on the subject of fascism and freedom, Porco is wanted by the fascist government while in the past he could fly freely in the Adriatic. Even while approaching these subjects, the film remains extremely entertaining and funny.</p>
