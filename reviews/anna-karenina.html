					<h2>Book Review: Anna Karenina</h2>
					<p>2025/07/30</p>
				</div>
				<div class="wrapper main-text">
					<p><i>Anna Karenina is a book written by Leo Tolstoy first published in book form in 1878.</i></p>
					<p>This is my favourite book and this has been the third time I've read it. More than a review, I think this will be a place where I can record what I've felt when reading this book for the third time. The edition of the book that I have is the Wordsworth Classics one translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude. The book is so long and covers so many topics that I've decided to split the review into different sections according to different characters. Each of the different sections will contain a summary of the character's story and at the end I will share my opinions. I will not comment much on the writing as this has been done already by other people. All of the citations will follow the format (p 1, ch 1, pg 1) where p is part, ch is chapter and pg is page for my edition of the book. <b>Spoilers ahead!</b></p>
					<h3>Constantine Dmitrich Levin</h3>
					<p>Levin starts the book as a man in love. He wishes to propose to Kitty and once he does he is rejected as the Shcherbatsky's think that Vronsky will propose to her too and think him a more suitable husband. He loses faith in marriage and the hapiness it could bring him and swears not to be carried away by passions again. For him marriage was the most important thing in life and his happiness depended on it.  He returns to the country and sinks himself in his work.</p>
					<p>For Levin, "the country was the place where one lived - that is to say, where on rejoiced, suffered and laboured", it was the place of "unquestionably useful labour" while he thought that the work his half-brother, Sergius Ivanich Koznyshev, did, "working for the general welfare [...] was not a virtue but a lack of something [...] of what is called heart" (p 3, ch 1, pg 234) even though he too lacked something. Levin expresses that he finds the local government institution, the Zemstvo, useless. He then declares "I only want to prove that I will always stand up with all my power for the rights which touch me and my personal interests" (p 3, ch 3, pg 242).</p>
					<p>After these discussions with his brother comes one of my favourite sections of the book, chapter four to six in part three. In this section, Levin mows grass with some peasants, mowing grass takes all of his attention and for some time he feels peace and forgets everything that was disturbing his mind. "The longer Levin went on mowing, the oftener he experienced these moments of oblivion when his arms no longer seemed to swing the scythe, but the scythe itself his whole body, so conscious and full of life; and as if by magic, regularly and definitely without a thought being given to it, the work accomplished itself of its own accord. These were blessed moments" (p 3, ch 5, pg 248). He later admires the simple life that peasants lived and even imagines himself renouncing his own life to live like the peasants do. But he once again remembers his love for Kitty when he sees her for an instant passing him on a carriage and loses all interest in his past farming work and adopts new ideas.</p>
					<p>He saw that he was always trying to implement the newest technologies and best models while the peasants wanted to maintain the status quo and were afraid of change, here nobody won. He recognized that as a landowner he wanted the peasants to work as much as possible while the peasants wanted to work pleasantly. His wishes as a landowner were incomprehensible to the peasants. He realizes that work done by the household who holds the land gives a higher yield than the land where peasants are hired to work at. Levin found that the best way to solve this problem would be to find a way to interest the labourers in the results of their work, to "Divide equally and give half the produce to labour, and the share left for you will be larger, and the labour force will receive more" (p 3, ch 29, pg 334). The implementation of these plans were only partially successful. He continues writing a book about farming in Russia as his opinions evolve and he thinks that it will revolutionize the subject.</p>
					<p>While in the farm, his brother, Nicholas Levin, visits him and he is for the first time in the book confronted with Death. He finds his brother emaciated, ill and weak "He was a mere skeleton covered with skin" (p 3, ch 31, pg 342). "Death would come and end everything, so that it was useless to begin anything, and that there was no help for it. Yes, it was terrible but true. [...] Just when the question of how to live had become a little clear to him, a new insoluble problem presented itself - Death" (p 3, ch 31, pg 344). Constantine loves his brother very much but Nicholas has a very irritable character and often argues with those he loves. After this, he goes abroad to research foreign farming practices. But once he comes back to Russia, he first goes to Moscow. Here he meets Oblonsky and tells him "And so one passes one's life finding distraction in hunting or in work, merely not to think of death" (p 4, ch 7, pg 370) maintaining his views on Death. In Moscow, he is invited to a dinner by Oblonsky.</p>
					<p>Chapters nine to thirteen of part four is also one of my favourite sections of the book, it is beautiful and filled with love. This part involves the dinner to which Levin was invited. Here he sees a lot of people, but most importantly, he meets Kitty for the first time since he saw her sleeping in a carriage. While he was in his farm, before having seen her in the carriage, Oblonsky visited him and told him that Kitty had not married Vronsky and that she had been abroad to a healing place. "Now, when he heard that she was here, he was suddenly filled with such joy and at the same time with such fear, that it took away his breath and he could not utter what he wished to say" (p 4, ch 9, pg 376).</p>
					<p>"There was, it would seem, nothing unusual in what she had said, but for him what a meaning there was, inexpressible in words, in every sound and every movement of her lips, her eyes, and her hands as she said it! There was a prayer for forgiveness, and trust in him, and a caress - a tender, timid caress, and a promise, and hope, and love for him in which he could not but believe and which suffocated him with joy. [...] Koznyshev, while continuing his conversation with the hostess, listened with one ear to his brother, turning his eyes toward him, and thought, `What has happened to him today? He behaves like a conqueror.` He did not know that Levin felt as if he had grown a pair of wings. Levin knew that she was listening to his words and liked hearing him, and that was the only thing he cared about. Not only in that room but in the whole world there existed for him nothing but Kitty and himself, and he had now acquired a great significance and importance" (p 4, ch 9, pg 379). "She and Levin were carrying on their own separate conversation, and it was not even a conversation but a kind of mystic intercourse, which every moment bound them closer and closer and created in both a feeling of joyful fear before the unknown upon which they were entering" (p 4, ch 11, pg 384).</p>
					<p>On a table prepared for cards Levin and Kitty started communicating only through the initials of the words they wanted to say by writing them on the table with a piece of chalk. They understood each other perfectly. Kitty asked for his forgiveness and to forget what had happened and "He seized the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, broke it, and wrote the initial letters of the following: `I have nothing to forget or forgive, I never ceased to love you.`" (p 4, ch 13, pg 392). Levin could propose to her and she would accept, this is what happened next. Before his proposal he was trapped in a state of blisssful love, everything seemed beautiful and any words trying describe his feelings felt vulgar. </p>
					<p>After he proposed, Levin gives Kitty his diary as a form of confession. In it, there was the confession of his agnoticism and everything else. Kitty was horror struct, not by his agnosticism but by everything else, but she forgave him. Before his wedding "Levin continued in the same condition of delirium as before, imagining that he and his joy were the chief or only purpose of all existence and that he need not now think or bother about anything, as other people would see to everything for him" (p 5, ch 1, pg 435). "Freedom? What is the good of freedom? Happiness consists in only loving and desiring: in wishing her wishes and in thinking her thoughts, which means having no freedom whatever; that is happiness" (p 5, ch 2, pg 442). He then married and "Levin felt more and more that his ideas of marriages and his dreams of how he would arrange his life had been but childishness, and that this was something he had never understood and was now still further from understanding, although it was happening to him" (p 5, ch 4, pg 452).</p>
					<p>Three months of marriage pass when he receives a letter that said that his brother Nicholas was in his deathbed. He went to visit him and Kitty insisted on going with him even with Levin saying that they would be in a place not suited for a lady and filled with bad characters. "Levin could not look at his brother calmly and could not be either natural or tranquil in his presence. [...] He was convinced beyond doubt that nothing could be done to prolong that life or to alleviate those sufferings" (p 5, ch 18, pg 490) while Kitty, when she saw Nicholas, acted almost immediately to do everything possible to alleviate his condition. "He did not know what to say, how to look, or how to step [...]. But Kitty evidently did not think and had no time to think of herself. She, prompted by some inner conviction, thought of him and, everything came out right" (p 5, ch 19, pg 493).</p>
					<p>"The sight of his brother and the proximity of death renewed in Levin's soul that feeling of horror at the inscrutability, nearness, and inevitability of death which had seized him on that autumn evening when his brother had arrived in the country. That feeling was now stronger even than before; he felt even less able than before to understand the meaning of death, and its inevitability appeared yet more terrible to him; but now, thanks to his wife's presence, that feeling did not drive him to despair; in spite of death, he felt the necessity of living and loving. He felt that love had saved him from despair, and that love under the menace of despair grew still stronger and purer" (p 5, ch 20, pg 501). Immediately after his brother dies, he finds out that Kitty is pregnant.</p>
					<p>While in his farm with Kitty, Levin has many visitors, one of them is Oblonsky who comes with a distant family relation, Vasenka Veslovsky, a young man. He starts courting Kitty as it was common for men his age to do at the time. This fills Levin with jealousy and Kitty does not know how to put an end to it and also feels uncomfortable with his presence. Veslovsky's presence was destroying their bliss but they decide to let him stay anyway thinking that a stranger should not be able to break their harmony. Levin proceeds to go hunting with Veslovsky and Oblonsky. During this hunting trip, Levin argues with Oblonsky about their wealth and easy life and whether it was unjust or not. Levin argues "But every acquisition out of proportion to the toil contributed is dishonourable" (p 6, ch 11, pg 581). Oblonsky asks Levin why doesn't he act if he thinks such inequalities unjust and he answers: "But I do act so, only in an negative sense, in the sense that I will not seek to increase the inequality that exists between my position and theirs". But Oblonsky says "[...] either you confess that the existing order of Society is just, and then uphold your rights; or else own that you are enjoying unfair privileges, as I do, and take them with pleasure" and Levin answers "No! If it were unjust, you could not use such advantages with pleasure; at any rate I could not. The chief thing for me is, not to feel guilty" (p 6, ch 11, pg 583). Levin asks himself if one can only act justly in a negative sense, he concludes that it is not his fault. After this unpleasant discussion and the whole of the previous day, which did not bring any good hunting for Levin, comes another one of my favourite chapters, chapter twelve in part five. Here Levin decides to wake up early and to go hunting on his own, the state of bliss transmitted in the grass mowing section is again repeated here. Once their hunting ends, they go back to the farm and Veslovsky continues courting Kitty and this tortures both Kitty and Levin. Levin asks Dolly for her opinion and she says that she has seen it but that there was nothing that could be done, he should not interfere and it was a common thing for the young men of those times to do. Levin could not believe this, and no longer able to bear their suffering, he kicks out Veslovsky even when people tell him he would look ridiculous. </p>
					<p>Levin then moves to Moscow for Kitty's confinement and here Koznyshev invites him to go with him to participate in the elections of a province he had an estate in. Levin was unoccupied in Moscow so he decides to go. In the elections Levin "tried not to condemn, not to dispute, but as far as possible to understand the matter" (p 6, ch 26, pg 639). The elections were confusing and filled with complications which Levin wasn't able to understand and quickly lost interest. Here he meets again a landowner he had met at Sviyazhsky's (a neighbour) before he married and they start talking. They agree that they find no meaning in these elections and that there is a new split between the old and new Nobility. The landowner says "New if you like, but not the Nobility. They are landowners; we are country squires. They, as noblemen, are committing suicide" Levin mentions that the landowner had said that the Nobility was an obsolete institution and he answers "It is obsolete certainly; but all the time one should treat it more respectfully. Take Snetkov ... Whether we are good or bad, we have been growing for a thousand years. You know, if we had to make a garden in front of our house, we should plan it out, and if a century-old tree is growing on that spot - though it may be rugged and old, yet you won't cut it down for the sake of a flower-bed, but will plan your beds so as to make use of the old tree! It can't be grown in a year" (p 6, ch 29, pg 648). And then they discuss their work. The landowner asks Levin how his work is going and Levin says that he makes about a five percent profit and the landowner answers that he earns about the same and that before he worked in his farm he earned a lot more in the Service. Levin asks him why he goes on with the work and the landowner answers "Well, you see ... one goes on! What would you have? It's a habit, and one knows it's necessary!" Levin replies that he feels the same and that "One feels a sort of duty toward the land" . The landowner tells him that he has a neighbour who is a merchant, and this neighbour told him that all his work was in order except for his garden, he could cut his limes and sell them for a profit and Levin answers "And he  will make a fortune, while you and I must be thankful if we can keep what we have and leave it to our children. [...] We live without gaining anything, as if we were appointed, like the vestals of old, to guard some fire or other" (p 6, ch 29, pg 649). Levin asks himself why don't they act like the merchant and the landowner says "Why, as you have said, we guard the fire! The other is not work for the Nobility. Our work is not here, at the elections, but at our homes. We have a class instinct as to what should not be done. I see it in the peasants too sometimes: a proper peasant always tries to get hold of as much land as possible. However bad the land, still he ploughs it. It brings him also no profit, but pure loss" (p 6, ch 29, pg 650).</p>
					<p>Two months in Moscow had passed and the baby was not yet born and Levin was restless. Kitty told Levin that she had met Vronsky at an occasion and she behaved correctly, she was proud of herself and he of her. They feared that going to Moscow would make them argue more over jealousy but this was the opposite, they had not argued once. In Moscow Levin had become more careless with money, spending it on things that in the country he would be stingy over. He also became careless with his farming business selling goods for prices well below market just to get cash. One day, he went to theater and then to the club, and when a bit tipsy, he was convinced by Oblonsky to visit his sister Anna. In part seven, chapter ten, Levin meets Anna and she does everything possible to enchant him with her beauty. When he got home, he tells Kitty what happened and she is quite sad by him having been enchanted by Anna. "One thing that he sincerely confessed was that, living so long in Moscow with nothing but talk and food and drink, he was going silly. They talked till three in the morning, and only then were they sufficiently reconciled to fall asleep" (p 7, ch 12, pg 693). On that night, Kitty tells him that she thinks she will go into labour soon and to get help.</p>
					<p>This section of the book is hard to relate to compared to the ones that have passed as I do not have any children. "[...] Levin was astonished at what was revealed to him now that every veil had fallen and the very kernel of her soul shone through her eyes. And in this simplicity, this nakedness of soul, she whom he loved was more apparent than ever. [...] He saw that something beautiful was taking place in her soul but what it was he could not understand. It was above his comprehension" (p 7, ch 13, pg 697-698). He was desperate and ran to the doctor and to get medicine. He could not understand how other people could act so normally and with so much patience. "He only knew and felt that what was happening was similar to what had happened the year before in the hotel of the provincial town on the deathbed of his brother Nicholas. Only that was sorrow and this was joy. But that sorrow and this joy were equally beyond the usual conditions of life: they were like openings in the usual life through which something higher became visible. And, as in that case, what was now being accomplished came harshly, painfully, incomprehensibly; and while watching it, the soul soared, as then, to heights it had never known before, at which reason could not keep up with. `Lord, pardon and help us!`" (p 7, ch 14, pg 703). After 22 hours of labour, his son is born. "What he felt toward this little creature was not at all what he had anticipated. There was nothing merry or joyful in it; on the contrary, there was a new and distressing sense of fear. It was the consciousness of another vulnerable region. And this consciousness was at first so painful, the fear lest that helpless being should suffer was so strong, that it quite hid the strange feeling of unreasoning joy and even pride which he experienced when the baby sneezed" (p 7, ch 16, pg 709).</p>
					<p>We finally reach the final chapters of the book, which are the densest and filled with most meaning. As in the start of the book, Koznyshev goes to visit Levin's farm but now he has many guests as opposed to the previous time. Kitty could see that all was not merry with Levin, there was something tormenting him: "It was his want of faith". He had been reading philosophy books trying to find an answer. "Well he is an unbeliever! Better let him be that than be like Madame Stahl, or like what I wanted to be when I was abroad. No, he will never pretend" (p 8, ch 7, pg 773). Levin found that "[...] the terms that had superseded these beliefs - were very useful for mental purposes; but they gave no guidance for life, and Levin suddenly felt like a person who has exchanged a thick fur coat for a muslin garment and who, being out in the frost for the first time, becomes clearly convinced, not by arguments, but with the whole of his being, that he is as good as naked and that he must inevitably perish miserably. [...] Levin never ceased to feel afraid of his ignorance" (p 8, ch 8, pg 774). And of philosophy and books, when he started to understand them and find the answer "But he had only to forget that artificial line of thought, and to return direct from real life to what had appeared satisfactory so long as he kept to the given line of thought - and suddenly the whole artificial edifice tumbled down like a house of cards, and it was evident that the edifice had been constructed of those same words differently arranged, and without regard for something in life more important than reason" (p 8, ch 9, pg 776). "Without knowing what I am, and why I am here it is impossible to live. Yet I cannot know that and therefore I can't live" (p 8, ch 9, pg 777). Levin came close to suicide, trying to free himself from that which he could not understand, but he kept on living. </p>
					<p>"When Levin thought about what he was and why he lived, he could find no answer and was driven to despair; but when he left off asking himself those questions he seemed to know what he was and why he lived, for he acted and lived unfalteringly and definitely - recently even more unfalteringly than before" (p 8, ch 10, pg 778). When he got back to the farm after his son's birth, he got back to work and this occupied all of his time. All of this work that he had once tried to justify with theories or science interested him now because it seemed to him that it was what he was supposed to do. Before, when he tried to do something for the general welfare, he could always justify it rationally but he was always dissatisfied with the undertaking and lost interest. Now, after marriage, he started to live more for himself and he felt that his work was necessary and progressed better than it used to. "Thinking about it [if what he was doing was right or wrong] led him into doubts and prevented him from seeing what he should and should not do. But when he did not think, but just lived, he unceasingly felt in his soul the presence of an infallible judge deciding which of two possible actions was the better and which the worse; and as soon as he did what he should not have done, he immediately felt this. In this way he lived, not knowing or seeing any possibility of knowing what he was or why he lived in the world, and he suffered so much from that ignorance that he was afraid he might commit suicide, while at the same time he was firmly cutting his own particular definite path through life" (p 8, ch 10, pg 780).</p>
					<p>When talking with a peasant in his farm Levin came to an answer to his questions, the peasant said "One man lives only for his own needs: take Mityuka, who only stuffs his own belly, but Plato is an upright old man. He lives for his soul and remembers God" and when Levin asked how did Plato do this the peasant said "You know how: rightly, in  godly way. You know, people differ" (p 8, ch 12, pg 783). Levin understood that we must not live for the things that we want or need "[...] but must live for something incomprehensible, for God whom nobody can understand or define" (p 8, ch 12, pg 783), he found that he understood the peasant completely and argues that it is the only thing that everybody understands. The thing that he understood is "If goodness has a cause, it is no longer goodness if it has a consequence - a reward, it is also not goodness. Therefore goodness is beyond the chain of cause and effect" (p 8, ch 12, pg 784). He realized that before "He had lived (without being conscious of it) by those spiritual truths which he had imbibed with his mother's milk; but in thought he had not only not acknowledged those truths, but had studiously evaded them" (p 8, ch 12, pg 785). "Where did I get it from? Was it by reason that I attained to the knowledge that I must love my neighbour and not throttle him? They told me so when I was a child, and I gladly believed it, because they told me what was already in my soul. [...] But the law of loving others could not be discovered by reason because it is unreasonable" (p 8, ch 12, pg 786).</p>
					<p>Promptly after this realization he promises not to argue with his wife, to receive all guests amiably and to treat the servants differently. But he at once reproaches a servant and disagrees with his brother, though this did not mean that his spiritual transformation had reverted. "This new feeling has not changed me, has not rendered me happy, nor suddenly illuminated me as I dreamt it would, but is just like my feeling for my son. It has not been a surprise either. But be it faith or not - I do not know what it is - this feeling also entered imperceptibly through suffering and is firmly rooted in my soul. I shall still get angry with Ivan the coachman in the same way, shall dispute in the same way, shall inopportunely express my thoughts; there will still be a wall between my soul's holy of holies and other people; even my wife I shall still blame for my own fears and shall repent for it. My reason will still not understand why I pray, but I shall still pray, and my life, my whole life, independently of anything that may happen to me, is every moment of it no longer meaningless as it was before, but has an unquestionable meaning of goodness with which I have the power to invest it" (p8, ch 19, pg 805-806).</p>
					<p>Throughout the book Levin made me question the meaning of life, work and love and how we should go about these. In the beginning he tries to rationalize everything he does and tries to have an answer for every question he comes across. By the end of the book he realizes that not everything needs to have and answer and he embraces his ignorance. He tries to live his life for goodness and love even though he doesn't completely understand what these are. Work starts as something productive and by the end of the book it becomes a responsibility, and something he enjoys to do and does well. Koznyshev finishes writing a book before he goes to visit his brother in the last chapters, he expected it would have a great impact on its subject but it is almost completely ignored and quickly forgotten. After Levin marries and has a son his work takes a greater significance as all he does will be passed down to him. When Kitty rejects him, love becomes an impossibility in Levin's mind but people and feelings change. Another matter of interest relating to Levin would be the difference between life in the city and life in the country. It is seen clearly that Levin is never comfortable in the city and he is much more at ease in the country. This may be because in the city people act in ways that are agreeable to Society and Levin doesn't understand this and doesn't know how to act this way, he doesn't fit in and doesn't want to fit in. By the end of the book he is still very much the same in this respect. The final subject relating to Levin is Death. He doesn't understand it and by the end of the book he is still not able to understand what it is but he realizes that life and Death become bearable and even at times beautiful when one has someone else to share it with, in his case, Kitty.</p>
