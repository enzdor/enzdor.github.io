					<h2>Book Review: The Way West</h2>
					<p>2025/05/01</p>

				<div class="wrapper main-text">
					<p>The Way West is a book written by Alfred B. Guthrie released in 1949.</p>
					<p>The book is about a group of travellers going along the the Oregon Trail around 1850, the main character is Lije Evans who is married and has a young son named Brownie. The other interesting character is Dick Summers, an older man who guides the travellers to Oregon.</p>
					<p>This is a book I've read in italian, so there may have been things that I missed out on because of it. I really enjoyed how this book is structured, each chapter being told in the point of view of a different member of the travellers. It mainly centers around the perspective of Lije Evans, but the most interesting chapters are in the point of view of Dick Summers, this is when you are able to peer into what was his life and what he is in search for.</p>
					<p>There is a contrast between Lije and Dick. Lije who is relatively young, has a son and wife to take care of, decides to take his family to Oregon, the place where all land is fertile and free for the taking if you are able to complete the long and difficult trip there, a place to have a future in. For Dick things are different, before he starts the trip, his wife passes, with no other relatives close by, he decides to guide the travellers to places he lived in when he was a young mountain man. Along the way he rediscovers his past and sees how things are changing, what once was wild is now becoming civilized, and he, a man of the wild, is becoming forgotten. There are other subplots that involve other characters in the group but I think that the contrast between Dick and Lije is the most interesting part of the book.</p>
					<p>My favourite chapter is number 20, told in Dick's point of view, in which he guides the group of travellers through a difficult mountain crossing. At the same time, he starts to remember long forgotten memeories. Another good chapter is the one in which the group discusses if they should cook with bison poop or not and who should collect it, told from the point of view of Hig, it is very funny.</p>
					<p>I really enjoyed this book, it starts off a bit slow and there are definitely chapters that are a bit of a slog but I really liked it.</p>
