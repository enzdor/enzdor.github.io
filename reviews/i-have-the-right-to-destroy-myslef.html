					<h2>Book Review: I Have The Right To Destroy Myself</h2>

					<p><i>I Have The Right To Destroy Myself is a book written by Kim Young-Ha first released in Korean in 1996. I read it in Spanish.</i></p>
					<p>This book is relatively short and follows different characters. The narrator is someone who tries to find people whom he can convince to commit suicide, C and K are brothers who both have sex with Judith, Mimi is a performance artist, and there is a young Chinese girl that the narrator meets who doesn't like to drink water. The narrator tries to convince Judith and Mimi of killing themselves.</p>
					<p>The narrator tries to convince people to kill themselves because he wishes to become a god and there are two ways to become one: through creation or through destruction. He thinks that nothing in the world ever changes no matter what we do and the only true decisions we can make is either to kill ourselves or create someone new. He thinks that we are all already dead.</p>
					<p>C meets Judith when she was staying over in his apartment with his brother, K, for their mother's funeral which K did not attend. C is a visual artist and K used to be a mechanic and is now a taxi driver. C is unable to love and feels no connection to this world, he tries to see through his cameras but he doesn't like it when people look at him filming. K also did not feel much, the only thing he felt was that he was dealt a mediocre hand in life. He spent his free time speeding and by the end of the book he feels that soon he will not step off the gas. K is obsessed with cars but knows that he will never be able to own a Ferrari or Porsche, he is also jealous of his brother as he always ends up taking what is his.</p>
					<p>Not much is said about Judith, she loves lollipops and is obsessed with the north pole, she is slowly forgetting her past. Mimi doesn't like to be filmed and feels that all forms of art that are not performance art are fake as they are a compromise and a vague search for immortality while performance art is the only expression of true beauty. The Chinese girl only drinks coke and vomits if she drink water. Both Mimi and the Chinese girl have had some sort of trauma related with sex. Sex in general is conveyed as something boring and insignificant throughout the book.</p>
					<p>I found this book a strangely interesting read. I do not agree with a lot of the opinions on life that the author expresses throughout the book. I also do not understand the inclusion of some parts like the Chinese girl's water trauma story or Judith's obsession with the north pole, some parts of the story feel meaningless. The storytelling feels similar to Murakami's but a lot more depressing and scattered. If you are looking for a depressing, short and a bit disgusting read, give this a shot, if not, skip it.</p>
