					<h2>Book Review: I Have The Right To Destroy Myself</h2>

					<p><i>I Have The Right To Destroy Myself is a book written by Kim Young-Ha first released in Korean in 1996. I read it in Spanish.</i></p>
					<p>This book is relatively short and follows different characters. The narrator is someone who tries to find people whom he can convince to commit suicide, C and K are brothers who both have sex with Judith, Mimi is a performance artist, and there is a young Chinese girl that the narrator meets who doesn't like to drink water. The narrator tries to convince Judith and Mimi of killing themselves.</p>
					<p>The narrator tries to convince people to kill themselves because he wishes to become a god and there are two ways to become one: through creation or through destruction. He thinks that nothing in the world ever changes no matter what we do and the only true decisions we can make is either to kill ourselves or create someone new. He thinks that we are all already dead.</p>
					<p>C meets Judith when she was staying over in his apartment with his brother, K, for their mother's funeral which K did not attend. C is a visual artist and K used to be a mechanic and is now a taxi driver. C is unable to love and feels no connection to this world, he tries to see through his cameras but he doesn't like it when people look at him filming. K also did not feel much, the only thing he felt was that he was dealt a mediocre hand in life. He spent his free time speeding and by the end of the book he feels that soon he will not step off the gas. K is obsessed with cars but knows that he will never be able to own a Ferrari or Porsche, he is also jealous of his brother as he always ends up taking what is his.</p>
					<p>Not much is said about Judith, she loves lollipops and is obsessed with the north pole, she is slowly forgetting her past. Mimi doesn't like to be filmed and feels that all forms of art that are not performance art are fake as they are a compromise and a vague search for immortality while performance art is the only expression of true beauty. The Chinese girl only drinks coke and vomits if she drink water. Both Mimi and the Chinese girl have had some sort of trauma related with sex. Sex in general is conveyed as something boring and insignificant throughout the book.</p>
					<p>I found this book a strangely interesting read. There are different things that I liked about this book. The first was that I really enjoyed how the story was structured, it not being completely linear and jumping from one character to the next and it all being easy to understand. The second thing that I liked is the author's recognition of the banality of life and the absurdity of trying to reach immortality, these are ideas that I agree with to an extent and I think are worth musing over. The last thing that I liked was that I learned about other artists, specially about Gustav Klimt. Finally, I liked the cover of my edition by the editorial Malas Tierras. The things that I disliked where the glorification of suicide and that some parts of the book felt a bit pointless and only there for shock vale. The book feels like a depressive version of Murakami, the act of reading the book is extremely enjoyable but once you finish it, you don't quite know what the book was trying to say or why anything in it took place. If you are looking for a depressing, short and a bit disgusting read, give this a shot, if not, skip it.</p>
