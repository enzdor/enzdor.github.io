					<h2>Book Review: The Warden</h2>

					<p><i>The warden is a book by Anthony Trollope first published in 1855.</i></p>
					<p>What is just, what do we deserve and what are the intentions behind our actions? All of these questions are posed in the most beautiful prose. Mr. Harding is the warden at Hiram's hospital and the presentor of Barchester Cathedral. As the warden of the Hospital, he is entitled to a very large income and this makes John Bold question whether he deserves this income or if it should be redistributed among the old men living in the Hospital. Mr Harding is not sure.</p>
					<p>I rarely comment on the writing style of the authors I review, but it is impossible not to with Trollope. The descriptions of the different characters are probably the best I have ever read. They are beautiful but are not baroque and are quite easy to understand. He is also a great comedian, inserting comedic reliefs perfectly. I love it when the narrator breaks the "fourth wall" and speaks directly to the reader.</p>
					<p>The book made me think that we should be careful of how we approach change. Sometimes things are working well but someone sees some injustice and tries to improve things and he leaves them worse than what they were at first. He who tries to change things should also consider if his intentions are genuine or not. Those who resist change should also consider this and whether or not things do actually need to change. The book also asks what do we deserve and what is just. Sometimes these two are not aligned.</p>
					<p>I really enjoyed this book and I think I will be reading a lot more Trollope in the future.</p>
