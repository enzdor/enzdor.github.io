					<h2>Book Review: Archittetura Open Source reloaded</h2>

					<p><i>Architettura Open Source reloaded is a book written by Carlo Ratti and published in 2025.</i></p>
					<p>What is the role of the architect and how to involve the community in the design of a project? This is the main question that the book seeks to answer and I'm not quite sure that it does. Some parts of the text feel extremely outdated even if the original was written less than ten years ago. The book is divided in two main parts, the first is a look at the past and the second is a look into the possible solutions.</p>
					<p>The first chapter presents the example of Le Corbousier, an architect who had little regard for those who would live in the buildings he designed and was only concerned with his view and ideology. Ratti argues that  Modernist architects became engrossed with the idea of designing everything, from the spoon to the city and that architects isolate themselves from the world they are supposed to design for. </p>
					<p>In the second chapter the author provides examples of architecture before the "archistar" existed. From early human settlements to cities like Rome. In these cases, architecture was a representation of the people who lived in it. He argues that the architect should look at his surroundings and help the evolution of the space in a way of collective art. The cycle stops and a new one begins when there is a big advancement in technology. He also mentions the method of construction of gothic cathedrals, a collaboration of different craftsmen throughout time, and those craftsmen would be the ones who would use the cathedral too. He then provides different examples of the evolution of this process but all of them lack the involvement of the community at large. I really like the fist half of this chapter and the look it takes into the past but the second half is just a bit dull and I don't see much purpose in mentioning so many failed examples.</p>
					<p>In the third chapter he starts with the example of Christopher Alexander, who carried out the Oregon Experiment. Here, he tried to create a common design language so that through participation the new buildings of Oregon University would be designed and built. The only problem was that people lost interest and there was no participation. If it couldn't work for a university, how could this be applied to cities? Ratti then argues that many of the future attempts of having participation from the community where only forms of pseudoparticipation where architects would reject most of the suggestions given by the community. I also really enjoyed the first half of this chapter but again, the second half is just too dull. I don't mind the several examples given but I do not think it was necessary to go so in depth.</p>
					<p>The fourth chapter deals with the open source and creative commons. It mentions Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, and Benjamin Franklin. It also says that we live in a "global village" since the creation of the printer and even more so the internet. With internet we can exchange ideas. In relation to open source, he argues that a product comparable to that made by billion dollar corporations was built with little to no economic incentive. The example of Wikipedia is also mentioned. Ratti argues that people are motivated by their values to do these contributions. This is an interesting chapter but it seems a bit optimistic.</p>
					<p>The fifth chapter talks about how open source becomes physical. He mentions the kitchen and the exchange of recipes and also mentions Enzo Mari's <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL59733279M/Autoprogettazione">Autoprogettazione</a>, a book I very much enjoy. He mentions something the economist Maynard Keynes said: "It is easier to ship recipes than cakes and biscuits". He also mentions Arduinos, Open Architecture Network (defunct), and <a href="https://wikihouse.cc">WikiHouse</a> (a very interesting project). Ratti argues that all of the tools for open source architecture are already in place from design systems to access to funds through crowdsourcing. But where is it? This is the most outdated chapter and it really shows, a revision is necessary to at least give more modern examples and explore what has happened in the last decade.</p>
					<p>The sixth chapter looks into the future and tries to determine the new role of the architect. Ratti argues that nowadays do not take into account the people they are designing the buildings for. There are different views he mentions relating to what the role should be: first, an intermediary that determines useful parameters to guide the corpus of ideas, a creator of "open schemes instead of deterministic forms". The second would be to concern himself not only with the space but with the events that he should make available to take place in it. The third, a creator of a system of adaptive "ecologies" that interact with the inhabitants in different ways. The fourth, he should participate in the evolution of the environment built autonomously through the creation of structures designed by those who use them. Each of these ideas comes from a different person but in general aim at the same thing, I just think there is a lot of word salad here. At the end of the chapter he reaches the idea of the choral architect who is no longer a soloist nor a director, nor an anonymous voice, he is able to merge the creative and harmonic ensemble.</p>
					<p>In the last chapter he explains how the book was written collaboratively with many contributors in a way similar to what he thinks open architecture should be. He sees the completion of the book as the possibility of open architecture. I found parts of this book interesting and very well written but at the same time I think it is very outdated in some parts and offers little answers to the questions he poses. It feels more like a history book than an exploration into the future.</p>
