					<p>What I've been doing, reading and listening to recently</p>
					<p>For the last month I've started to work on a new project called <a href="https://github.com/enzdor/gbc">gbc</a>. I'm trying to make my own implementation of gradient boosting in C. I'm currently reading the book <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3177246M/Classification_and_regression_trees">Classification and Regression Trees</a> published in 1984 by Breiman et al. It explains the methods used to create trees efficiently in computer programs. I hope to finish this program in the next week or two so that I can move on to my next project. This next project I'm eager to work on is a chess engine. I hope to learn how neural networks work as it feels like a natural progression from gradient boosting. I also really like chess, I'm not a very good player though. Another thing I plan to do, not necessarily after these projects, is to film some videos explaining how <a href="https://github.com/enzdor/ss-py">ss-py</a> works. I also plan on making a quick tour of the website where all of the data from the models is currently hosted. In the longer term I hope to create a website to host the data from the baseball models I create like <a href="https://lichess.org">lichess</a>, it being free and open source with no ads and no subscriptions. I also need to update <a href="https://github.com/enzdor/cpi-csi">cpi-csi</a> and its website.</p>
					<p>Asides from this, I've been re-reading for the third time <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL267096W/Anna_Karenina">Anna Karenina</a>, it is my favourite book. I think it is the kind of book where every time you read it, you'll pick up different things, and your opinions on events and characters can change from read to read.</p>
					<p>I've been working out as always. I'm now doing exercises like hand stands and pike push ups to be able to do hand stand push ups. I hope these will help me grow my shoulders. I also think that in the near future I will be buying weights so that I can do weighted dips and pull ups.</p>
					<p>Finally, some of the music I've been enjoying recently:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Operelly - You Don't Have One Hope <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PByMIqEJ_4">[link]</a></li>
						<li>Celestaphone & Dealers of God - Cult Subterranea <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQvAAAZ4nak">[link]</a></li>
