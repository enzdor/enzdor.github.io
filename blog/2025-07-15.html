					<p>Yes, I broke my wrist. Some of the plans that I had will need to be delayed and other will progress at a slower pace. This comes at a time when I thought I was about to finally move into a different stage in my life, it will have to wait. The mentality I try to have is that each day is going to be better, it is going to be easier, but there are moments when it gets really tough. It is not all negative though, I think it has helped to have some grace and appreciate how fortunate I am.</p>
					<p>The plans I'll be putting off are mainly related to work and fitness (I'm not allowed to do calisthenics or to run with a cast). I'll try to slowly move through my coding projects even though I'm only able to type  with one hand. Ever since I broke my wrist I haven't worked on <a href="https://github.com/enzdor/gbc">gbc</a>, I know I need to get back to it. The things that are going to definitely pick up some pace are my reads, I'm more than half way through <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL267096W/Anna_Karenina">Anna Karenina</a>. The next books I plan on reading:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Archittetura Open Source reloaded - Carlo Ratti <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL59567840M/Archittetura_Open_Source_reloaded">[link]</a></li>
						<li>SÃ£o Paulo nas alturas - Raul Juste Lores <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL59567968M/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_nas_alturas">[link]</a></li>
						<li>Le Nuvole - Aristofane <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL59568109M/Le_Nuvole">[link]</a></li>
						<li>Orestea - Eschilo <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL59568075M/Oresteia">[link]</a></li>

					</ul>
					<p>And what I've been listening to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Brad pitt - Shy High <a href="https://youtu.be/s7Y4Yo6_3l8?si=TkEiyzHhDRyYmPh6">[link]</a></li>
						<li>Come On - Barry White <a href="https://youtu.be/XX_wu_TOTmU?si=4_m_JpZ7-fRkAESy">[link]</a>
					</ul>
					<p>That is everything for now, I'll take it slow, hope you do too!</p>
